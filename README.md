# TheHungryCaterpillar

### By Graham Falk

Using the story and characters from Eric Carle's famous childrens book *The Hungry Caterpillar*, I recreated it into p5.js

It justs much like reading a book in that things happen on a slide or a "page" and then you press "Next" to move on or "Back" to go back. Once you start, the sun rises and you have to wake the caterpillar named Wormie up by popping his sleepy bubble, next Wormie has to eat so you have to feed him everything he wants, then he has to climb a tree to make his cocoon so you have to type to help him climb, lastly you see him transform into a butterfly!
